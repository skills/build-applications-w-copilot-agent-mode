# The OctoFit Tracker app story for Mergington High School

## Building a Fitness App with GitHub Copilot agent mode for Mergington High School

Welcome to Mergington High School! In this hands-on skills session, you'll step into the shoes of a high school gym teacher tasked with creating a cutting-edge fitness tracker app in record time. We'll leverage the power of **GitHub Copilot: agent mode** to rapidly develop a functional prototype of **OctoFit Tracker**, a social fitness app that encourages students to stay active and to compete with their peers.

### Workshop Overview

In this workshop, you'll:

1. Set up a development environment using **GitHub Codespaces**
2. Use **GitHub Copilot** to accelerate development across multiple technologies
3. Build key components of the **OctoFit Tracker** app with the help of Copilot agent mode
4. Learn best practices and prompting techniques for working with **GitHub Copilot agent mode**

### Application Features

**OctoFit Tracker** will include:

- User profiles
- Activity logging and tracking
- Team creation and management
- A competitive leaderboard
- Personalized workout suggestions
