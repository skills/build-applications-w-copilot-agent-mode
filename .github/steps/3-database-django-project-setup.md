## Step 3: Initialize and create the octofit_db MongoDB database, update Django project/app files, and populate the MongoDB database

In this step, we will accomplish the following:

- Set up the octofit_db MongoDB database structure.
- Update the octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker app files:
  - settings, models, serializers, urls, views, tests, and admin files.
- Populate the octofit_db database with test data.
- Verify the test data is populated in the octofit_db database.

1. Open all files in the `docs` folder and keep this file open in the editor.
2. Click the GitHub Copilot Chat, click the :paperclip:, and add "Open Editors" to the prompt.
3. Copy and paste the following prompt in the GitHub Copilot Chat and select the "Agent" instead of "Ask" or "Edit" from the dropdown where you are inserting the prompt.

>[!NOTE]
> Do not change the model from GPT-4; this will be an optional activity at the end of the course.
> Keep in mind that the Copilot agent mode is conversational, so it may ask you questions, and you can ask it questions too.
> Wait a moment for the Copilot to respond and press the continue button to execute commands presented by Copilot agent mode.
> Keep files created and updated by Copilot agent mode until it is finished.
> Agent mode has the ability to evaluate your codebase and execute commands and add/refactor/delete parts of your codebase and automatically self-heal if it or you make a mistake in the process.

> ```prompt
> Based on the example monafit tracker app in the docs/mona-high-school-fitness-tracker.md file and use octofit as the name for Merington's high school's app. Let's initialize the octofit_db database.
>
> 1. Initialize the mongo octofit_db database.
> 2. Create a correct table structure for users, teams, activity, leaderboard, and workouts collections.
> 3. Make sure there is a unique ID for the primary key for the user collection.
>   ex. db.users.createIndex({ "email": 1 }, { unique: true })
> 4. Execute the command for me to create the database.
> 5. List the collections in the octofit_db database.
> 
> Don't proceed with the next activity until all of these steps are completed.
> ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If there is no "Continue" button, just pull the left side of the GitHub Copilot Chat panel over to the left, and it should appear.
> If this doesn't work, you may need to copy and paste the response in the terminal if there is no "Continue" button.

1. Now that we have created the database structure, updated our Django project files, and populated the database, let's check our changes into our `build-octofit-app` branch.

1. With our new changes complete, please **commit** and **push** the changes to GitHub.

1. Wait a moment for Mona to check your work, provide feedback, and share the final lesson. Almost done!

<details>
<summary>Having trouble? ðŸ¤·</summary><br/>

If you don't get feedback, here are some things to check:

- Make sure your commit changes were made for the following file to the branch `build-octofit-app` and pushed/synchronized to GitHub:
  - `octofit-tracker/backend/requirements.txt` and it contains the package `Django==4.1`
- If Mona found a mistake, simply make a correction and push your changes again. Mona will check your work as many times as needed.
