## Step 3: Initialize and create the octofit_db MongoDB database, Django project/app, update Django project/app files, and populate the MongoDB database

In this step, we will accomplish the following:

- Set up the octofit_db MongoDB database structure.
- Update the octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker app files:
  - settings, models, serializers, urls, views, tests, and admin files.
- Populate the octofit_db database with test data.
- Verify the test data is populated in the octofit_db database.

Copy and paste the following prompt(s) in the GitHub Copilot Chat and select the "Agent" instead of "Ask" or "Edit" from the drop down where you are inserting the prompt.

> [!NOTE]
> - Keep in mind that the Copilot agent mode is conversational so it may ask you questions and you can ask it questions too.
> - Wait a moment for the Copilot to respond and press the `Continue` button to execute commands presented by Copilot agent mode.
> - Keep files created and updated by Copilot agent mode until it is finished.
> - Agent mode has the ability to evaluate your code base and execute commands and add/refactor/delete parts of your code base and automatically self heal if it or you makes a mistake in the process.

### :keyboard: Activity: Setup the Python Django project/app

In this activity we will leverage a feature in vscode called prompt files. A prompt file that has been created by the IT department for us to create our Django project application. Copy/paste the following prompt in the GitHub Copilot Chat and select the "Agent" instead of "Ask" or "Edit" from the drop down where you are inserting the prompt.

>
> ```prompt
> /create-django-project
>```

> [!NOTE]
> - Wait a moment for the Copilot to respond and press the `Continue` button to execute each command presented by Copilot agent mode.
> - Keep files created and updated until the Copilot agent mode has finished.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Don't start the Python Django app in the way that GitHub Copilot agent mode suggests hit **cancel**.

### :keyboard: Activity: Initialize and create the octofit_db MongoDB database

Let's continue to leverage a prompt file that has been created by the IT department for us to initialize and create the octofit_db MongoDB database. Copy/paste the following prompt in the GitHub Copilot Chat and select the "Agent" instead of "Ask" or "Edit" from the drop down where you are inserting the prompt.

> ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Prompt-text?style=flat-square&logo=github%20copilot&labelColor=512a97&color=ecd8ff)

> ```prompt

> /init-populate-octofit_db
> ```

### :keyboard: Activity: Update the Python Django project/app files

Now let's create a prompt file of our own that we can share with other staff to develop to build the octofit-tracker app. Copy/paste the following prompt in the GitHub Copilot Chat and select the "Agent" instead of "Ask" or "Edit" from the drop down where you are inserting the prompt.

> ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Prompt-text?style=flat-square&logo=github%20copilot&labelColor=512a97&color=ecd8ff)
>
> ```prompt
> Let's add the following to a prompt file called `update-octofit-tracker-app.prompt.md` in the `.github/prompts` directory and add mode: 'agent' and model: GPT-4.1 to the prompt file.
>
> ## Use the existing Python virtual environment
>
>  - Use the existing Python virtual environment we already created in directory octofit-tracker/backend/venv.
> - Do not create a new Python virtual environment as part of this process.
> source octofit-tracker/backend/venv/bin/activate
>
> ## Update octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker app files
>
> 1. Update the octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker/settings.py file to include the MongoDB database connections for octofit_db and djongo with no authentication.
> 2. Update the octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker/models.py file to include the models for users, teams, activities, leaderboard, and workouts collections.
> 3. Update the octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker/serializers.py file to include the serializers for users, teams, activities, leaderboard, and workouts collections.
> 4. Update the octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker/urls.py file to include the URLs for users, teams, activities, leaderboard, and workouts collections.
> 5. Update the octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker/views.py file to include the views for users, teams, activities, leaderboard, and workouts collections.
> 6. Update the octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker/tests.py file to include the tests for users, teams, activities, leaderboard, and workouts collections.
> 7. Update the octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker/admin.py file to include the admin for users, teams, activities, leaderboard, and workouts collections.
> 8. Make sure api_root is in octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker/urls.py
> 9. Enable CORS in the octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker/settings.py file to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend React app and allow all origins, methods, and headers.
> 10. Allow all hosts in the settings.py file.
> 11. Install CORS middleware components.
> 12. Make sure there are apps for octofit_tracker, rest_framework, and djongo in the INSTALLED_APPS setting.
> ```

> [!TIP]
> Use prompt files to define repeatable tasks and workflows.
>
> When writing prompts focus on **WHAT** needs to be done. You can reference instructions for the **HOW**.

### :keyboard: Activity: Let's use the prompt file to update the Python Django project/app files

Copy/paste the following prompt in the GitHub Copilot Chat and select the "Agent" instead of "Ask" or "Edit" from the drop down where you are inserting the prompt.

> ‚ùï **Important:** Don't start the Python Django app in the way that GitHub Copilot agent mode suggests hit **cancel**.

### :keyboard: Activity: Populate the octofit_db database with test data from Django project/app files

> ```prompt
> Let's populate the octofit_db database with test data.
>
> - Create test data for users, teams, activities, leaderboard, and workouts collections.
>
> - Activate the Python existing virtual environment octofit-tracker/backend/venv/bin/activate.
> 
> 1. Run makemigrations and migrate the database in a Python virtual environment.
> 2. Populate the octofit_db database with test data for users, teams, activities, leaderboard, and workouts collections based on test data in our instructions to octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker/management/commands/populate_db.py.
> 3. Help message in populate_db.py contains 'Populate the octofit_db database with test data'
> 4. Verify the test data is populated in the octofit_db database.

> ‚ùï **Important:**
- Don't start the Python Django app in the way that GitHub Copilot agent mode suggests hit **cancel**.
- If there is no `Continue` button, just pull the left side of the GitHub Copilot Chat panel over to the left, and it should appear.
- If this doesn't work, you may need to copy and paste the response in the terminal if there is no `Continue` button.

1. Now that we have created the database structure, updated our Django project files, and populated the database, let's check our changes into our `build-octofit-app` branch.

1. With our new changes complete, please **commit** and **push** the changes to GitHub.

1. Wait a moment for Mona to check your work, provide feedback, and share the next lesson so we can keep working!
