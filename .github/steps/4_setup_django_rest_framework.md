## Step 4: Setup django REST Framework, restart the server, and test the API

In this step, we will will accomplish the following:

- Setup the django REST Framework.
- Restart the server.

> Wait a moment for the Copilot to respond and press the continue button to execute commands presented by Copilot agent mode.
> Keep files created and updated by Copilot agent mode until it is finished.

Based on the requirements in the docs/mergington-tech-policies.md file. Let's setup codespace for the url, restart the server, and test the API.

1. Activate the python virtual environment.
2. Update #file:octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker/views.py to replace the return for the rest api url endpoints with the codespace url https://[REPLACE-THIS-WITH-YOUR-CODESPACE-NAME]-8000.app.github.dev for django and avoid certificate HTHS issues.
3. Make sure the django backend works on [REPLACE-THIS-WITH-YOUR-CODESPACE-NAME].app.github.dev and localhost:8000.
4. Run the Django server in the background with "&".
5. Test the API end points using curl command.
6. Make the Forwarded port public in the codespace

Don't proceed with the next activity until all of these steps are completed.
