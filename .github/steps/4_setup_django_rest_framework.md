Based on the requirements in the docs/mergington-tech-policies.md file. Let's setup codespace for the url, restart the server, and test the API.

1. Activate the python virtual environment.
2. Update #file:octofit-tracker/backend/octofit_tracker/views.py to replace the return for the rest api url endpoints with the codespace url https://[REPLACE-THIS-WITH-YOUR-CODESPACE-NAME]-8000.app.github.dev for django and avoid certificate HTHS issues.
3. Run the Django server.
4. Test the API end points using curl command.

Don't proceed with the next activity until all of these steps are completed.
