## Step 5: Setup the frontend React framework, update the components, and start OctoFit Tracker app

In this step, we will accomplish the following:

- Setup the octofit-tracker frontend React framework.
- Update the following components to include the React framework:
  - src/App.js
  - src/index.js
  - src/components/Activities.js
  - src/components/Leaderboard.js
  - src/components/Teams.js
  - src/components/Users.js
  - src/components/Workouts.js
- Start the React app and check the output.

Copy and paste the following prompt(s) in the GitHub Copilot Chat and select the "Agent" instead of "Ask" or "Edit" from the drop down where you are inserting the prompt.

> [!NOTE]
> - Keep in mind that the Copilot agent mode is conversational so it may ask you questions and you can ask it questions too.
> - Wait a moment for the Copilot to respond and press the continue button to execute commands presented by Copilot agent mode.
> - Keep files created and updated by Copilot agent mode until it is finished.
> - Agent mode has the ability to evaluate your code base and execute commands and add/refactor/delete parts of your code base and automatically self heal if it or you makes a mistake in the process.
